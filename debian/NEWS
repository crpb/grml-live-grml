grml-live-grml (0.18.0) unstable; urgency=low

  grml-live-compat has turned into an empty transitional package.
  Instead of using the files previously provided by the compat
  package, grml-live now uses the files directly from the chroot.
  This has the implication that all addons that should be
  available must be installed into the chroot.
